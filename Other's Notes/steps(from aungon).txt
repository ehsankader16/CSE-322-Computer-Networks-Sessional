------------------------------
(network part of ip should have to match)
1. enable password 
2. conf a vlan interface on the switch with an ip
3. configure a telnet password (line vty 0 15)

1. enable password
2. configure ip address of the line that is connected to the switch/Device
3. set ip address, subnet mask and default gateway on the pc
4. up vlan 1 (no ip required)
5. set telnet password (line vty)

vlan configuration
------------------
1. create vlans on individual switches
2. assign vlans on individual ports in access mode
3. assign native and other vlans to trunk port (line connecting to other switch)
4. configure ip addresses of the PCs

legacy inter-VLAN routing

2. assign vlans on individual ports in access mode
3. connect the router with the switch. (one line for every vlan. Max 2 is possible)
4. set ip of the router lines from the router side
5. set default gateways of the PCs

Router on a stick inter-VLAN routing
------------------------------------
1. create vlans on individual switches
2. assign vlans on individual ports in access mode
3. connect the router with the switch (use only one port)
4. set the port as trunk on the switch side
5. configure subinterfaces in router (no. of subinterfaces = no. of vlans)
6. set default gateways of the PCs
